# React Tic Tac Toe

This exercise is taken from a [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) which shows how to build a tic-tac-toe game.

In addition to the main tutorial, I went ahead and refactored out the components and some functions to their own files and completed all the suggested improvements at the end of the tutorial.

Given more time, I'd refactor the component classes further and add test coverage.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
